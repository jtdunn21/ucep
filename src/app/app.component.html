<!-- Data Preprocessing: A dedicated component for preprocessing data before ingestion, including data cleaning, 
normalization, and quality checks.
Machine Learning: Integration of a Language Model (LLM) using TensorFlow for natural language processing tasks, 
along with a machine learning model for other predictive analytics or recommendation tasks.
User Interface (UI): Not included in the diagram, but a UI component could be added to facilitate user 
interactions with the system.
External Integrations: External systems, APIs, or third-party services for enriching customer engagement 
capabilities could be integrated but are not represented in this diagram.
This enhanced architecture provides a more comprehensive view of the UCEP, covering data preprocessing, 
machine learning, and analytics components, in addition to the existing data ingestion, processing, storage, 
notification, and monitoring layers. -->

<!-- System Architecture Overview

Slide 1: **Introduction to Data Ingestion**
- The architecture begins with data ingestion from an external API.
- Data flows through an API Gateway, which acts as the entry point.
- This leads to an authentication check before data reaches the Ingestion Server.

Slide 2: **Data Processing Pipeline**
- Post-authentication, the Ingestion Server sends data to the Processing Server.
- The Processing Server handles the operations and service orchestration.
- Processed data is then sent to a database for storage, with a backup stored in an S3 bucket.

Slide 3: **Preprocessing and Machine Learning**
- Concurrently, data preprocessing occurs on a separate Preprocessing Server, where data quality checks are 
performed.
- The preprocessed data feeds into a Machine Learning Model, possibly a Language Model (LM), for further 
analysis and insights.

Slide 4: **Notification and Data Analysis**
- Based on certain triggers, a message is queued.
- The Notification Server picks up the message and acts accordingly.
- Analytics data is processed by an Analytics Server, which also generates relevant metrics and logs.

Slide 5: **Monitoring and Logging**
- The system is monitored continuously, with logs collected and stored.
- Metrics and logs are crucial for system health checks and performance analysis.

Slide 6: **Caching and Backup**
- The architecture includes a caching layer for frequently accessed data.
- Backups ensure data durability and are crucial for disaster recovery plans.

Slide 7: **Conclusion**
- This architecture provides a robust framework for handling, processing, and analyzing data with AI integration.
- It emphasizes security, scalability, and efficient data management.

This summary outlines the key components and the flow of data through the system, suitable for a short presentation 
format. Each slide should focus on a specific aspect of the architecture, providing a clear understanding of the 
system's operation. -->
